# IDEs 

There are several IDEs available for Lua on OS X. Since this is not a business that generates income I wanted a free, or at least low cost, IDE. I initially tried ZeroBrane which seemed to be a good IDE except that it didn't have the (Emacs) cursor motion/selection keybindings I am use to. So why don't I use Emacs? Emacs is a fantastic program but it is not really an editor, or an IDE. It is a lisp programming and execution environment that is frequently used as an editor. Many people use it productively but configuring it seems to be a black art that results in near infinite "bit twiddling". 

Next I tried my goto editor Sublime Text. It is already good at editing files so I added three packages. 

1. REPLSublime - Runs a REPL for a selected language in a ST window. 
2. Autocomplete - What the name says.
3. LuaExtended - Better syntax highlighting.
4. MonokaiExtended - Prettier syntax highlighting.
5. sublemacspro - Makes ST more Emacs awesome.
6. OrigamiEmacs - Better window control.

So far I am quite pleased with the results.
